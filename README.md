# Sorting Algorithm Visualization
This Python program provides a visualization of sorting algorithms, allowing users to observe the step-by-step process of sorting a list using various algorithms. The visualization includes real-time updates as the algorithms progress.

## Features

- Visualization of sorting algorithms: Currently supports Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.
- Adjustable frame size for a better viewing experience.
- Customizable color scheme and font selection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/profannyti/sorting-algorithm-visualization.git
    cd sorting-algorithm-visualization
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. Run the program:

    ```bash
    python your_script.py
    ```

## Usage

- Press `R` to reset the visualization.
- Press `SPACE` to start sorting.
- Use `A` for ascending order, `D` for descending order.
- Switch between sorting algorithms with `I` for Insertion Sort and `B` for Bubble Sort.
